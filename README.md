# Learning to learn: evidence for meta-learning in 8-month-old infants

## About the project:
Meta-learning is the ability to make use of prior experience to learn how to learn better in the future. Whether infants possess meta-learning abilities is still unknown. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that keeps track of how the informational value of the stimuli changes across time. By fitting the model to infantsâ€™ eye-tracking data, we show that infants attention and information processing is in line with the presence of meta-learning abilities.
