## About the project:
Meta-learning is the ability to make use of prior experience to learn how to learn better in the future. Whether infants possess meta-learning abilities is still unknown. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that keeps track of how the informational value of the stimuli changes across time. By fitting the model to infantsâ€™ eye-tracking data, we show that infants attention and information processing is in line with the presence of meta-learning abilities.


### The task

Infants were presented with sequences of cue-target trials. In each sequence, the cue consisted of a simple shape appearing in the middle of the screen. The target was the same shape reappearing in one of four screen quadrants around the cue location. The shape was the same across all trials of the sequence but changed across sequences. The target could appear in any location, but one location was more likely than the others. Infants could thus learn to predict the most likely target location of each sequence.

## Try for yourself 

### Install pymc3 and its dependencies
To facilitate the process and aim for the best reproducibility we provide the **pymc_enviroment.yml**file in the [General folder](https://github.com/TommasoGhilardi/LearningToLearn/tree/main/General). To create a conda enviroment called *pymc* run the command:  ```conda env create -f pymc_enviroment.yml``` in the conda terminal.
After setting the enviroment it can be accessed using ```conda activate pymc```, from here the ilde **Spyder** can be accessed running ```spyder```
